        <h2>Carborhydrates</h2>
        <p>Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy. They are divided into simple carbohydrates (sugars) and complex carbohydrates (starches and fiber).</p>
        <p>Along with proteins and fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and drinks.</p>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Legumes</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="Protein">
        <h2>Protein</h2>
        <p>Proteins are essential for building and repairing tissues, as well as for the production of enzymes and hormones.</p>
        <p>They do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs.</p>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <ol>
            <li>meat </li>
            <li>Poultry </li>
            <li>Fish </li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="Fats">
        <h2>Fats </h2>
        <p>Fats are concentrated sources of energy and are important for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. They can be saturated or unsaturated.</p>
        <p>The body also uses fat as fuel. If fats eaten aren't burned as energy or used as building blocks, they're stored by the body in fat cells.</p>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter </li>
            <li>Oils </li>
            <li>Avocados </li>
            <li>Nuts </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="Vitamins"> 
        <h2>Vitamins</h2>
        <p>Vitamins are organic compounds that are crucial for various physiological functions, including metabolism, immune function, and cell maintenance.</p>
        <p>However, these micronutrients are not produced in our bodies and must be derived from the food we eat. Vitamins are organic substances that are generally classified as either fat soluble or water soluble.</p>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Vitamin A </li>
            <li>Vitamin C </li>
            <li>Vitamin D </li>
            <li>Vitamin K</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <Section id="Minerals">
        <h2>Minerals</h2>
        <p>Minerals are inorganic elements necessary for the formation of bones and teeth, nerve function, and fluid balance.</p>
        <p>We need more of some minerals than others.</p>
        <p>Examples</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Calcium</li>
            <li>Iron</li>
            <li>Magnesium</li>
            <li>Potassium</li>
        </ol>

            <h2></h2><dt>Water</dt>
            <dd>Water is essential for various bodily functions, including digestion, absorption, and transportation of nutrients. It also helps regulate body temperature.</dd>
            <dd>Water plays a vital role in many bodily functions, including regulating body temperature, carrying nutrients and oxygen to cells, and removing waste products from the body.</dd>
